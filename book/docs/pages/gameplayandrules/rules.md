### Rules
- Rule 1: The game starts with each player choosing a set of four pieces (usually colored red, blue, green, and yellow) and placing them on the starting square.

- Rule 2: The objective of the game is to move all four pieces around the board and return them to the starting square before your opponents.

- Rule 3: On each turn, players roll two dice to determine how many spaces they can move their pieces.

- Rule 4: The number on each die represents how many spaces a piece can move. For example, if a player rolls a 3 and a 6, they can move one piece 3 spaces and another piece 6 spaces.

- Rule 5: Pieces can only move forward, never backward.

- Rule 6: If a piece lands on a square occupied by an opponent’s piece, it can “knock off” that piece and send it back to the starting square.

- Rule 7: A piece can only be moved to a square that is empty or occupied by an opponent’s piece.

- Rule 8: If a player rolls a double (two 6s), they can move one piece the total number of spaces shown on the dice (e.g., 6 spaces for two 3s).

- Rule 9: if a player 3 pieces reached Home, only one is left. and the piece reached the home column. A person should be shifted to one Dice, if the player wants to play with 2 dice he/she gets the exact number which in the case of one, is not possible

- Rule 10: If a player has no pieces on the board, they can only roll the dice to try to get a double, which allows them to enter a piece into play.

- Rule 11: The game ends when one player has all four pieces back on the starting square. That player is the winner.
